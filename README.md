[cite_start]**Roll To Learn** is an innovative 3D educational game developed as a major project at Parul University[cite: 2, 3]. [cite_start]It's designed to make learning an engaging adventure by blending real-world exploration with a dynamic, multimedia-rich quizzing system[cite: 75]. [cite_start]Unlike traditional educational games that rely on repetitive formats, this project immerses players in a visually compelling environment where knowledge acquisition is driven by curiosity and discovery[cite: 75, 91].

### üéØ Problem Statement

[cite_start]Many educational games fail to captivate players due to simplistic, repetitive question-answer formats[cite: 91]. [cite_start]They often lack immersive storytelling, real-world context, and a rewarding sense of progression, limiting their educational impact and entertainment value[cite: 93, 94]. [cite_start]**Roll To Learn** bridges this gap by creating an interactive experience where learning is a fun and impactful part of the gameplay, not just an objective[cite: 94].
